# palindrome-map

A palindrome is a word that reads the same way forward and backwards (i.e. racecar, reviver, rotator).

Write a JS function that takes a string argument and returns an array of true/false values that map to whether the word in that position is palindrome or not.

Use the .map function in your solution and don't use any loops.

Test Case

palindromicMap("stash and pop on this level")
Would return

[false, false, true, false, false, true]
